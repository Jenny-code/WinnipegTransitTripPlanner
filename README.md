# WinnipegTransitTripPlanner
This application shows the trip steps from point "a" to point "b" in Winnipeg based on user inputs, using data obtained from Winnipeg public transit API.

With a maximum of at most 3 options for trips. If there are no available trips based on input, the program will display that there are "no available trips". The application shows the first trip as recommended, since this can be done in less time.

Displays the estimated time between each segment of a proposed trip. The possible segments of the trip are "walk", "Transfer" and "Ride".
